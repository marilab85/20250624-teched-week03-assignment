# 20250624-teched-week03-assignment

For this week's assignment, I had a lot od difficulties going on regarding the code and thisgs not related.
I had very little time this week to dedicate because of outside things going on, very little sleep so, by the time I actually managed to start (and do my best) to sort of finish the assignment, I was very tired and couldnt thing too much about the code itself.

This doesn't happen really often, but I had my husband abroad, 1 extra dog at the house, lots of pets to visit, deliveries, emergencies... Even during class, which wasn't great. Next week should be back to normal. The extra dog woke me up 4:30 in the morning EVERY DAY... so, this is where sleeping became a problem.
Enough about the whys :)

Regarding the code...
Didn't figure out how to add the text inside the images. I tried a few things, researched the best I could, but in the end, I decided it looked OK-ish and it was best to at least deliver a acceptable visual, even if it is not what the assignment asked for.

I did some mix and match between classes and build up a code that is a bit of Frankeinstein, but I'm not very happy with the result, that does only a few of the requirements.

I'm reading all I can about HOW a code works, so I can break it down and trully understand it. At the moment I'm confident I'll learn how to replicate the lessons, but I didn't fully undertood how to build something myself. I know it is week03, but I'll work it out.

Thanks again for a great week!
Marina.
